Create folders here with themes.

If your add files to the theme that match the file name from code/views, and then you activate the
theme (see config_example.php), your theme's files will be used instead of the default files. It is
worth noting, however, that you do not need to copy every default theme file over. If the view template
the code is looking for is NOT present in your theme, it will use the default view template.
