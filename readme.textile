h1. Kindling

Inspired by the content type simplicity of tumblr, but desireing my own self hosted solution, and unhappy with Wordpress/Drupal like overbearing solutions, I created Kindling.

Kindling is simple blogging system that has a minimilistic admin, no-b.s. template overrides, and is backed by Redis making it insanely fast.


h2. Setup

I *HIGHLY* reccommend that you install the Kindling in your webserver like this:

bc. + /var/www/site.com/
+-- config.php
+-- site/
|   +-- uploads/
|   +-- index.php
|   +-- css/
|   +-- js/
|   +-- img/
+-- code/
+-- theme/

The Kindling code should be placed inside the code folder. The @docroot@ for your virtual host should be pointed at the @/var/www/site.com/site@ folder. This ensures that the only PHP file in your docroot is @index.php@, while the remaining exposed files are all static files.

After that, you must also have the @site/uploads/@ folder present so that you may upload images. (You will also likely need to set the permissions of that folder to allow upload -- Kindling will attempt to do this on its own, but may fail and ask you for help.)
